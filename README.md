# ðŸ¥’ pickles

Pick audio samples.

Install `ffmpeg`, clone this repo, cd into it and run `./pickles`.
The program will recursively find all wav files in your samples folder.
Each file will be played, and you must assign it to a folder.
If you leave a blank folder name, the file will be removed.
When in doubt, just reassign the file back to the samples folder.
