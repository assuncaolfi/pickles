# ðŸ¥’ pickles

Pick (audio) samples (or music).

Install `ffmpeg`, clone this repo and run `source pickles`
to recursively look for all wav files in your samples folder.
Each file will be played, and you must assign it to a folder.
If you leave a blank folder name, the file will be removed.
If in doubt, just reassign the file to the samples folder.
